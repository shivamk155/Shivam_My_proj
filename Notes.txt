List of approaches of a problem

1. Using hashing or HashMaps and HashSets
2. Using stacks and queues , even multiple stacks and queues at a time.
3. Using trees , BST, BT, Min heap, Max Heap, AVL tree
4. Using graphs, directed or undirected.
5. Always tries to see a pattern in the problem
6. Tries for one very very simple or general set. ---> Very Very very Imp tip
